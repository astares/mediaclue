# Main configuration file for your mediaclue installation via Ansible
#

mediaclue:

  # ===== BASIC SETTINGS ==============

  # Your organization names
  organizationName: 'My Cool Organization'
  organizationShortName: 'MCO'

  # Your domain of the web application (Must be reachable in your network!). Example: media.myorg.com
  appDomain: "your.host.domain"

  # Domain where your organization emails are from. Example: myorg.com
  emailDomain: "email.host.domain"

  # Email address of the mediaclue Administrator. Use your own email, I guess.
  adminEmail: "you@email.host.domain"

  # Mediaclue does not send emails directly. It will forward it to an SMTP server
  # You probably should have an SMTP inhouse, anyway. If you need SMTP-authentication,
  # set the configuration options in the admin backend of mediaclue.
  # Example: smtp.myorg.com
  smtpRelayhost: "your.smtp.host.domain"


  # Is your mediaclue not ready for production? If you would like to hide your application behind an extra HTTP basic authentication, use this feature.
  # HTTP Basic Auth Username is "betatester", choose password here:
  isBeta: false
  betaPassword: "beta"


  
  # ===== ADVANCED SETTINGS (Leave them untouched, if unsure) ==============

  # Should your mediaclue instance be reachable by HTTPS? Certificates are being generated automatically with certbot (let's encrypt)
  # Works only if the domain is public, because certbot will validate the domain online.
  useSsl: false

  # Alternative domain name
  appDomain2: "alternative.host.domain"
  
  # Installation folder of mediaclue application
  installationPath: "/opt/mediaclue"

  # Folder where the actual user media files will be stored
  mediaStoragePath: "/var/mediaclue-files"

  # Internal port where the Pharo application will be started (Default 8087)
  pharoPort: 8087

  # Location of the source code (default github main repository)
  # Once in the format of git-SSH, once in the format of Metacello (Pharo internal)
  # Warning: Only changes this, if you have your own fork of mediaclue, or similar.
