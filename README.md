# Web based media assets management

(German: __Mediendatenbank__)

Mediaclue is an open source digital assets management application. It is mainly targeted for schools.
Mediaclue was developed from mindclue gmbh (www.mindclue.ch) in cooperation with
Gymnasium Hohe Promenade, ZÃ¼rich (www.kshp.ch).

Official website: http://www.mediaclue.ch

(This version has been rewritten from scratch from the previous Rails based application.
Ruby and Rails is cool, but hey, Smalltalk and Seaside is just, hm, you know, just feels alot better! ;-) )

# Installation

TBD

* Get a fresh Linux server, e.g. Ubuntu Server, where mediaclue should be installed.
* Clone this repository and its submodules to your development machine: `git clone --recurse-submodules <URL>` .
* Get ansible on your development machine: http://ansible.com
* Choose a short code for your the mediaclue instance. For example your organization name ("tesla"), or application purpose ("media") or similar short name.
* Create a ansible vault password in a file and set it in ansible.cfg
* Put your public key(s) which should be SSH authorized in the server into the directory files/ssh/authorized_keys/
* Create a deployment inventory for ansible: Create inventory_yourname.yml file from the template file inventory_template.yml
* Create a configuration for mediaclue: Create mediaclue_yourname.yml file from the template file mediaclue_template.yml
* Use the script install.sh yourname

# Deployment updates

TBD

Once your mediaclue server is up and running, you will use these scripts:

* update.sh to simply lightweight update your source code and files, without the application itself.
* deploy.sh to do a full deployment with stopping the application, update and restart.

# Technical stuff

* Developed with Pharo Smalltalk (www.pharo.org) and the Seaside web framework (www.seaside.st)
* Autostarts an OpenOffice server instance in the background for document conversion.
* Keeps original file stored on disk. Separates generated preview files in an other folder structure. Making it easy for backing up the original files.
* As a developer you can connect to the Pharo UI using xpra (xpra.org). Get the client for your OS and attach to xpra display number 100 on the server. You need SSH access privileges for this to work.
